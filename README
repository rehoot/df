df.py is a simple directory navigator for UNIX (tested on Mac OS X)
This is in ALPHA test mode -- meaning that you should expect missing
features or bugs.

This program is a way to navigate directory trees by 
selecting directory names from a list. The user can enter the number
that is associated with a directory name in the list, then the
program will list the directories in that location and allow for
iterative choices.  The user can enter shell commands or use the
"S" option to goto that directory in a fresh shell. The "O" option
allows the user to open the given file if its file extension has
an appropriate association with a program that can open it.

The name of the program "df" stands for "directory freedom," which
is a program that I vaguely remember from about 15 years ago.  It
was a DOS-based program that allowed the user to navigate directories
quickly by selecint directories from a list.

Installation:
1) Copy this single script to a directory that is in the execution
path (like /usr/bin).
2) Check the path to the python program in the first line of this
script -- there is a good chance that you need to change it.
3) Copy or review the .dfconfig file and create some shortcuts to
go to directories that you use often.  An example file is

[options]
language = Klingon

[shortcuts]
~ = /Users/rehoot
D = /Volumes/D/Documents
M = /Volumes/MACBACK
S = /Volumes/SSD
P = /Volumes/D/Documents/unix/python
V = /Volumes/D


Instructions:
1) Run this script and enter numbers to select the directory that
   you want to view.  Option 1 will typically go to the parent
   directory.
2) Press 'F' to open a list of favorites, then choose the shortcut
   code to go to that directory.
3) If you select option S this program will attempt
   to invoke a new shell and go to the selected directory.
   this program will exit after you type "exit" in the new subshell
   and you will return the df.py program.
