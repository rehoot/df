Instructions:
1) run this script and enter numbers to select the directory that
   you want to view.  Option 1 will typically go to the parent
   directory.
2) I hard-coded some shortcuts that are listed near the bottom
   of the screen.  You can change those by editing this python
   script.
3) You can run a shell command from the currently-selected
   directory by entering something like:
   !ls -l
   where the "!" is the code that the rest of the line is a shell
   command.
4) If you select option G for "goto," this program will attempt
   to invoke a new shell and go to the selected directory.
   this program will exit after you type "exit" in the new subshell
   and you will return to the old shell prompt were you started
   this python script.
